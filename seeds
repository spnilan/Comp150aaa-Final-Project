1335794147573   -disease avian-flu -observability 0.2 -symptom-tolerance 0.9 -num 10
Avian flu, low observability, low paranoia, flocking
Low observability and very trusting agents -> all agents die quickly


1335794844722   -disease malaria -observability 0.9 -symptom-tolerance 0.2 -num 10
Malaria, good observability, high paranoia, flocking
After malaria kills two agents, remaining agents are chased around by one agent
who is perceived as infected. Very amusing to watch. Go to about 650 steps or
so.

1335795282879   -disease cold -symptom-tolerance 0.8 -observability 0.2 -num 10
Cold, low observability, not paranoid, flocking
Agents perceive each other as healthy, keep spreading disease to one another
after they recover
 

1335803277138   -flocking 0 -disease cold -symptom-tolerance 0.2 -observability 0.2
Cold, low observability, paranoid, no flocking
